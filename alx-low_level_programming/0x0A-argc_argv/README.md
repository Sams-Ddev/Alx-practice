# 0x0A. C - argc, argv

This project is about learning how to use arguments passed to your program in C.

## Resources

* [Arguments to main](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_functions_with_arguments.htm)
* [argc and argv](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_argc_argv.htm)
* [What does argc and argv mean?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1865860/what-does-argc-and-argv-mean)
* [how to compile with unused variables](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1532374/how-to-compile-with-unused-variables)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* How to use arguments passed to your program
* What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
* How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called `main.h`
* Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
* You are allowed to use the standard library

## Tasks

* [0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to](./0-whatsmyname.c)
* [1. Silence is argument carried out by other means](./1-args.c)
* [2. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter](./2-args.c)
* [3. Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument](./3-mul.c)
