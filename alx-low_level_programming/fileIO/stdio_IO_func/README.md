File Input/Output (I/O) Handling in C
Introduction
File Input/Output (I/O) is an essential aspect of programming. It allows you to read data from files and write data to files. In C, you can perform file I/O operations using the stdio.h library, which provides functions like fopen, fclose, fread, and fwrite. This study note will cover the fundamentals of file I/O handling in C.

Opening and Closing Files
1. Opening a File
To open a file, use the fopen function.

Syntax: FILE* fopen(const char* filename, const char* mode);

Example: FILE* file = fopen("example.txt", "r");

Modes:
"r": Read (file must exist).
"w": Write (creates a new file or truncates an existing one).
"a": Append (creates a new file or appends to an existing one).
"rb", "wb", "ab": Binary mode.
2. Closing a File
To close a file, use the fclose function.
Syntax: int fclose(FILE* stream);
Example: fclose(file);
Reading from Files
3. Reading Characters
Use fgetc to read a character from a file.
Syntax: int fgetc(FILE* stream);
4. Reading Strings
Use fgets to read a string (line) from a file.
Syntax: char* fgets(char* str, int n, FILE* stream);
5. Reading Numbers
Use fscanf to read formatted data from a file.
Syntax: int fscanf(FILE* stream, const char* format, ...);
Example: fscanf(file, "%d", &num);
6. End of File (EOF)
EOF is a constant representing the end of the file.
Use it to check if you've reached the end of the file.
c
Copy code
int ch;
while ((ch = fgetc(file)) != EOF) {
    // Process characters
}
Writing to Files
7. Writing Characters
Use fputc to write a character to a file.
Syntax: int fputc(int c, FILE* stream);
8. Writing Strings
Use fputs to write a string to a file.
Syntax: int fputs(const char* str, FILE* stream);
9. Writing Numbers
Use fprintf to write formatted data to a file.
Syntax: int fprintf(FILE* stream, const char* format, ...);
Example: fprintf(file, "%d %f", num, pi);
Error Handling
10. Checking for Errors
Always check if file operations succeed.
c
Copy code
if (file == NULL) {
    perror("Error opening file");
    return 1;
}
File Positioning
11. Moving File Position
Use fseek to move the file position indicator.
Syntax: int fseek(FILE* stream, long offset, int origin);
Example: Reading and Writing Files
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE* file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
    if (file == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return 1;
    }

    // Reading from the file
    int num;
    fscanf(file, "%d", &num);
    printf("Read from file: %d\n", num);

    // Writing to the file
    FILE* outFile = fopen("output.txt", "w");
    fprintf(outFile, "Data from the program: %d\n", num);
    fclose(outFile);

    // Close the input file
    fclose(file);

    return 0;
}

c
Copy code
FILE* binaryFile = fopen("data.bin", "rb");
10. File Position and Seeking
Understanding and managing the file position is crucial when working with large files or when you need to move back and forth within a file. The fseek() function allows you to set the file position:

SEEK_SET: Set position from the beginning of the file.
SEEK_CUR: Set position relative to the current position.
SEEK_END: Set position from the end of the file.
Example: Move to the 10th byte from the beginning of the file.

c
Copy code
fseek(file, 10, SEEK_SET);
11. Handling File Errors
When handling files, it's important to deal with errors gracefully. You can use functions like feof() to check for the end of file and ferror() to check for file errors.

Example: Checking for errors after a file operation.
