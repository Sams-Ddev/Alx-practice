# ALX Low-Level Programming - C Basics

## Overview

This repository contains solutions for the ALX Low-Level Programming course's project on C programming basics. The project covers topics related to variables, if-else statements, while loops, and basic arithmetic operations in C.

## Resources

Read or watch the following materials:

- "Everything you need to know to start with C.pdf":
  - Slides to understand: "comments", "Data types | Integer types", "Declaration", "Characters", "Arithmetic operators", "Variables assignments", "Comparisons", "Logical operators", "if, if…else", "while loops".
- Keywords and identifiers
- Integers
- Arithmetic Operators in C
- If statements in C
- If…else statement
- Relational operators
- Logical operators
- While loop in C
- While loop
- man or help:
  - ascii (You do not need to learn about scanf, getc, getchar, EOF, EXIT_SUCCESS, time, rand, srand, RAND_MAX, for loops, do...while loops, functions.)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following topics without the help of Google:

- General:
  - Arithmetic operators and their usage
  - Logical operators (boolean operators) and their usage
  - Relational operators and their usage
  - Values considered TRUE and FALSE in C
  - Boolean operators and their usage
  - Usage of if and if...else statements
  - How to use comments in C
  - How to declare variables of types char, int, and unsigned int
  - How to assign values to variables
  - How to print the values of variables of type char, int, and unsigned int with printf
  - How to use the while loop
  - How to use variables with the while loop
  - How to print variables using printf
  - Understanding the ASCII character set
  - Purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64

## Copyright and Plagiarism

- You are responsible for coming up with solutions for the tasks on your own to meet the learning objectives.
- Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
- You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file should be present at the root of the project folder
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use the system function
- Your code should use the Betty style, and it will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

## Tasks

1. **Positive anything is better than negative nothing (mandatory)**
   Description: This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints whether the number stored in `n` is positive, negative, or zero.

2. **The last digit (mandatory)**
   Description: This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number stored in `n`.

3. **alphABET (mandatory)**
   Description: This program prints the alphabet in lowercase and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

4. **When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off (mandatory)**
   Description: This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.

5. **Numbers (mandatory)**
   Description: This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

6. **Numberz (mandatory)**
   Description: This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. You can only use the `putchar` function.

7. **Smile in the mirror (mandatory)**
   Description: This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

8. **Hexadecimal (mandatory)**
   Description: This program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

9. **Patience, persistence, and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success (mandatory)**
   Description: This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

10. **Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need (advanced)**
    Description: This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

11. **The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do... (advanced)**
    Description: This program prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

12. **Software is eating the World (advanced)**
    Description: This program prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
